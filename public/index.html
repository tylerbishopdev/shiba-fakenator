                  the web and should auto-download the .mp4 file autopmatically
                  in the browser when you enter that url to the browser. To use
                  Vercel, go to storage > blob > tylertest.mp4 for an example.
                  there'll be a copy url button that provides the right url if
                  you use vercel blog for your upload. When you have that url,
                  thats what you will paste into the file upload ionpout on the
                  application once it's running and the ai will begin training a

                  In a bustling city where the echoes of courtrooms and whispers
                  of justice intertwined, prosecutors had opened a massive
                  investigation into allegations of fixing games and illegal
                  betting. The legal system, like different telescope designs,
                  aimed to expose the truth, each method possessing unique
                  strengths and weaknesses. As the investigation unfolded, the
                  need to strengthen the education of good lawyers became
                  evident. Feedback from seasoned professionals became crucial;
                  it had to be timely and accurate throughout the project. Just
                  like humans judging distance by the relative sizes of objects,
                  the legal team sought clarity amid the complex web of
                  allegations. Yet, in the grand scheme of things, this
                  information seemed insignificant. Churches, however, insisted
                  on addressing the issue, emphasizing that they should not
                  encourage such activities or make them look harmless. It was a
                  moral stance against the backdrop of legal intricacies. Amidst
                  the legal turmoil, individuals found solace in unrelated
                  pursuits, such as learning about setting up wireless network
                  configurations. The city's residents, like the varied ways to
                  consume food, could choose to eat their worries fresh, cooked,
                  or fermented. Rumors circulated that those who tended to think
                  creatively were somehow different, and if true, they could be
                  the key to unlocking the mystery behind the alleged
                  game-fixing. A creative perspective could be the honeymoon of
                  clarity in this legal fog. In the courtroom, as the trial
                  progressed, the atmosphere was heated. The sugar syrup of
                  evidence dripped slowly, creating very fine strands of truth
                  that draped over the handles of justice. The accused wiped
                  their brows with their forearms, grappling with the pressure.
                  The legal system, however, had its quirks. Instead of fixing
                  the issue at hand, they gave it a nickname, a moniker that
                  belied the gravity of the charges. But amid the legal
                  intricacies, about half the people who were infected with the
                  allegations also lost weight, shedding the burden of deceit.
                  The second half of the legal saga focused on argument and
                  essay writing, a meticulous process of presenting facts and
                  weaving narratives. Funding became an issue after the fact,
                  leaving the legal team to reflect on the odd fashion choice of
                  addressing problems only when they surfaced. Yet, despite the
                  challenges, there was a prevailing sentiment of encouragement.
                  "Let us encourage each other," became the rallying cry. In the
                  end, as the legal battle continued, individuals found strength
                  in unity, understanding that they had the means to help
                  themselves in the pursuit of truth and justice.
